## Overview
This app will act as a digital cookbook for itâ€™s users. 

### Description

In this app, users can view recipes from different categories of food and also be able to add their own recipes to the app. Users can also search for recipes by their title in a search bar. Each recipe will include: ingredients, preparation steps, cooking steps, and the possibilty of adding a picture of the cooked recipe. Users can also rate the recipe, giving both a rating for how it tasted and a rating for the cooking process (easy to hard).
