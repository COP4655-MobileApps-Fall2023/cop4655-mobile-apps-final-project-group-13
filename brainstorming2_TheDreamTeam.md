## Description
Making a list of unique app ideas that could be candidates for our final project.
##
# App Idea 1: MovieMatch 
**What:** This is a movie recommendation app that recommends movies to users based on their preferences and also allows them to add the movies they have watched to their list. By adding the movies to the list, you are telling the app to not recommend you those movies. Moreover, users will also be able to leave a rating on the movies they have already watched. 
**Who:** This app will be designed for movie enthusiasts of all ages who struggle to find the perfect film to watch, whether it's based on genre, or specific interests.
**Why:** Building this app to solve the common frustration of spending more time scrolling through streaming platforms than actually enjoying a movie. Our app simplifies movie selection by providing tailored recommendations, enhancing the overall cinematic experience.
**Challenges:** One of the challenges in development will be deciding on implementing an algorithm that works best to recommend movies. The algorithm could be based on the type of movies users have already watched or the genre the user likes. A distinctive feaature that sets this app apart from others is its ability to avoid recommending movies already in the user's watched list.


# App Idea 2: FitCapture
**What:** This app will act as an accountability gym app among partners, friends, groups, etc. A user will show they are at the gym by snapping a photo then and there, which shares with their group. Each group can also opt into setting a point system for a certain time frame, which will track who took the most photos during the time. 
**Who:** This app is targeted for gym goers who may want to be in a competition with friends, or even those who want to keep their gym partners accountable of going. 
**Why:** It is easy to skip out on the gym or make excuses not to go. This app will help gym partners give each other motivation to go. 
**Challenges:** The main challenge would be to find a way to ensure users dont cht the system by posting old photos. Also, with the point system, there has to be a way for users to not get a point by just posting any picture.


# App Idea 3: BudgetBuddy
**What:** This app allows users to create a login (for security) to a daily expense tracker. Users can create entries for their purchases and categorize them with the amount spent as well as a description of their expense.
**Who:** This app is targeted towards young adults or college students that typically have a tight budget and would like to see what most spent money is going towards.
**Why:** We are building this app to fulfill a gap in the market for expense trackers specifically made for young adults. Many expense trackers include features for mortgages, insurance and what not. Instead the app is more simple and easy to use for smaller budgets.
**Challenges:** Some potential challenges will be implementing the login system for security as it can be difficult to create specific conditions for passwords. Another challenge may be getting our app to work on multiple devices with constraints.

# App Idea 4: QuoteToday
**What:** This app will display a random quote to the user from an API.
**Who:** This app is for people who want to read quotes to either be motivated or want to learn more quotes.
**Why:** Quotes are a great way to get motivated as you can use that to focus on a goal. It can also teach you about another perspective and learn from the person who said the quote.
**Challenges:** The challenge would be finding an API for it or have a list of pre-made quotes to randomly fetch from.



# App Idea 5: RecipEasy
**What:** This app will act as a digital cookbook for it's users. Users can add their own recipes to the app. Each recipe added will include: ingredients, preparation steps, cooking steps, and the possibilty of adding a picture of the cooked recipe. Users can also rate the recipe, giving both a rating for how it tasted and a rating for the cooking process (easy to hard). Recipes can be shared to other people or kept to self.
**Who:** The app is built for anyone old enough to cook and follow directions. Any person of any age can use this app to input their recipes.
**Why:** This is a convenient way to share and keep recipes in this day of age. It allows its users to organize, access, and share recipes in an easier way.
**Challenges:** It may be challenging to implement the sharing/exporting of recipes to outside users. Constraining images to multiple devices will likely be another challenge during development.
